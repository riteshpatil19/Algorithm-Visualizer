🧠 Algorithm Visualizer
An interactive Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users understand how different algorithms work step-by-step through live animations.
This project is designed for learning and demonstration purposes, especially for DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) concepts.
🚀 Features

✅ Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort

Functions:
Adjustable array size
Speed control
Start / Reset / Stop
Back button to main page
Real-time bar animation
Highlighted comparisons and swaps

✅ Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
Functions:
Automatic sorting for Binary Search
Value input for searching
Speed control
Stop button
Found / Not Found indicator

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure of the application
CSS3 – Design and layout
JavaScript (ES6) – Logic and animations
No external libraries or frameworks are used.

🎯 Future Improvements (Short)
Add Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
Add Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
Add Dynamic Programming problems (LCS, Knapsack, Fibonacci)
Add Backtracking problems (N-Queen, Maze, Sudoku)
Integrate AI-based explanation system that explains each step in simple language
Show pseudocode and code explanation panel alongside visualization
Add Pause / Resume / Step-by-step controls
Add sound effects and complexity analysis (Time & Space)
Include Learning Mode & Challenge Mode for students
This will turn the project into an AI-based interactive learning platform for DSA.
